# Knots-and-Graphs
#
# This project is a series of tools to be used by the Knots and Graphs math research group at OSU, ran by Sergey Chmutov.
# The tools so far completed or in development are:
# - A program to calculate the Arrow polynomial of a virtual knot (equivalent to the Jones polynomial of a classical knot).
# - A program to recognize a knot from an image of that knot, which can be used as input for the Arrow polynommial program and others to come.
#
# Future tools include more programs to calculate different invariants of knots, and possibly a tool to draw and manipulate knots.
